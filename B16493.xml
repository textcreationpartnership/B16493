            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>THAT the World, my Self, and the Stars may be no longer abused by Counterfeit Predictions of the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that my Name may be no more Prophan'd by being set to Sham Prophecies, and that every one may know that I am not plac'd upon a Hill, like the Devil upon <hi>Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeple,</hi> only to shew the variation of the Wind: I am resolved, for my own and <hi>Ʋrania</hi>'s Honour, to undertake this present Frost, to determine its Force and Continuance, that the Poor providing themselves in time with Fuel and Flannel, should not be forc'd to burn their Wooden Shoes (as they have often done) to warm

If you inquire into my Lineage you must confess me best qualify'd for this Undertaking of any Pretending Astrologer in <hi>France.</hi> For, not to mention my other Qualifications, I am Descended in a Right Line by my Fathers side from <hi>Merlin</hi> and <hi>Erra P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But that we may proceed according to the rules of Art, I am First to Calculate the Nativity of this Present Frost, which hapned at <hi>Paris</hi> exactly upon <hi>November 16, Stilo Vetere,</hi> at Four in the Morning, that cold Sign <hi>Scorpio</hi> ascending three Planets in the Horoscope; opposing the Moon in an Earthly Sign, in evil Aspect of that enemy to all Warmth: <hi>Saturn</hi> the Lord of the Ascendant in an Earthly sign also.

So that, according to Natural Astral Causes, (and I believe no other) it cannot last less than 103 days, 7 hours, 25 minutes, 17 seconds; till then it shall without the least remission Freeze, so that no man shall venture to Urine in the Streets of <hi>Paris;</hi> and in the Northern parts of <hi>France</hi> many shall be Frozen to Death in Carnal Copulation. And truly considering how little Heat I have (except in my Head) or can my self make, my Wife and I have every terrible Apprehensions of that our Selves. Nay it shall be as common a thing to buy a pair of Scates to slide from <hi>Calice</hi> to <hi>Dover,</hi> as it is to take a Scull from <hi>Greenwich</hi> to <hi>Tower stairs.</hi> And I very much fear that the Crust which has so long been over the Suns Body, will now be doubty coated with Ice, so that the little remaining Light will be so intercepted, that we shall not have so much benefit of it as to see truly the Hour of the Day But no sooner shall the Thaw come, but

I will have them know that when I set my self to Prophesie, Nature her Self shall Obey, and the Fates shall sooner change than I Lye; I mean when I Prognosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate. For tho the Quadrate of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> from Angles in my Nativity, and both in Evil Aspect to my Horoscope, have beat out my Teeth, and bent my Legs so that I can neither Kick nor Bite, yet every one knows that to be a Position which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishes me the better for Railing, and Scolding, and throwing of Dirt: and this is so Notorious, that when ever I land at <hi>Billings<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> the boldest Fish-whore of them all dare as well eat her <hi>Oyster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shells</hi> as encounter me. I know well enough that the Vulgar Astrology will tell you, that he who hath that Position is very apt to be a Lyer, and to be believed in nothing that he says; and a Deceiver, to be trusted in nothing that he does; and 'tis true enough, provided you understand it only in a mans ordinary Dealings and common conversation, but, (as a Reverend Brother <note n="*" place="margin">Butlers Christolog.</note> Astrologue has told us in the Calculation of Christs Nativity,) in other matters it gives the more prodigious Wit, and qualifies a man the better for Predictions. What tho it cannot be prov'd that ever I spoke well of any Man, not excepting my Royal Founder (whose Bounty for so many years maintain'd me) or that very Church whose Livery I wear? What tho I never Published any thing for the instruction of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind beyond a Tide-Table, for the use of my Neighbouring Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termen? What is this to my Prophetick Spirit? I am not the first of my Order that has been Proud, Peevish and Unsociable. How many Nights have I sat Cross Legged, tooting upon the Stars to foresee the downfal of Kings and the Destruction of my own Enemies? How many years have I Dieted my self that I might commence Prophet? For they are not Poets only that diet themselves to become Proficients only in the Art they Profess. Do

Do I not Supconstantly upon a Dish of Poach'd Stars, with Sippits in <hi>Hippomanes</hi> to render my self the more accomplished <hi>Wizzard,</hi> and fitter for the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of <hi>Silphs</hi> and <hi>Gobblins.</hi> Why then shold the World be Surprized that I, who have always declaim'd and rail'd against Astrology, <hi>repente sic Propheta nunc prodirem:</hi> but do they not know that I have always been a man of Mystery and lived in the Clouds? Why may not I be supposed to understand Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, which I never publickly own'd, as well as be a Novice in <hi>Algebra,</hi> of which I would be feign thought a Master? In a word, hath not the World been mistaken in every Particular of me, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting only my Morals, and my good Nature?
